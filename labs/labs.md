# Labs

These are the network labs for CSCD 330 Networks at EWU. The labs are programming that go over different concepts seen in Networking. The labs are split into segments:

1. Introduction to Socket Programming:<br/>
    This segment gives an introduction to programming with TCP and UDP.
    - [Lab 1](lab1/lab.md):<br/>
        This introduction uses stream based sockets to utilize a TCP connection. It is a very basic lab that does message exchanging.
    - [Lab 2](lab2/lab.md):<br/>
        This introduction uses datagram based sockets to utilize a UDP connection. It functions the same way as lab 1
2. Understanding Protocols:<br/>
    This segment goes over protocols and there importance in networking in the following programming labs
    - [Lab 3](lab3/lab.md):<br/>
        This lab implements a naive version of the TCP protocol over a UDP connection.
    - [Lab 4](lab4/lab.md):<br/>
        This lab implements a simple FTP protocol
    - [Lab 5](lab5/lab.md):<br/>
        This lab implements a simple HTTP server for a Web API application
3. Cryptography:<br/>
    This segment goes over cryptography in networking
    - [Lab 6](lab6/lab.md):<br/>
        This lab goes over encrypting a connection. AES will be the utilized algorithm
4. Client/Server Model:<br/>
    This segment looks at a client/server model and the complexities that come with that
    - Lab 7:<br/>
        This lab focuses on the client side
5. LAN:<br/>
    This segment focuses on concepts related to LAN
    - Lab 8:<br/>
        This lab focuses on creating a client for DHCP
